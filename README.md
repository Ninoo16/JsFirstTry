*// Understanding the problem:
i need to make a game of "rock, paper, scissors" to play against the computer

*// pseudocode:
-create a function called getComputerChoice().
-generate a random number between 0 and 2.
-use switch statement to return "rock, paper, scissors" based on the random number.
-create a function with two parameters (playerSelection, computerSelection) that plays a round of the game.
-convert playerSelection to lowerCase and make it case-insensitive. 
-determine the winner based on the selections.
-write a new function called game() using the previous function inside to play a 5 round game that keeps score and reports a winner or loser at the end.
